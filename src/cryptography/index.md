## Trap door Functions

A trapdoor function is a function that is easy to compute in one direction, yet difficult to compute in the opposite direction (finding its inverse) without special information.

## Why modulo

make the compute irreversible.
for example:
$5\times x=500 \hspace{1cm} \rightarrow \hspace{1cm} x=500 \div 5=100 \\$
$5 \times x \pmod{7}=3$, x may equal 2, may equal 16ï¼Œmay equal 100 ...
