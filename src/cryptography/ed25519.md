# EsDSA and Ed25519

EdDSA(Edwards-curve Digital Signature Algorithm) is based on performance-optimized elliptic curves,such as the 255-bit curve Curve25519 and 448-bit curve Curve448-Goldilocks. The **EdDSA** algorithm is based on the Schnorr signature algorithm and relies on the difficulty of **ECDLP** problem.

## Ed25519 equation

\\( -x^2+y^2=1-(121665/121666)x^2y^2 \\)

## EdDSA Key Generation

* private key: \\(d_A\\)
* publick key: \\(Q_a=d_A * G\\)

## EdDSA Sign

* Deterministically generate a secret integer: \\( r=hash(hash(d_A)+msg) \bmod q \\)
* Calculate: \\( R=r * G \\)
* Calculate: \\( h=hash(R+Q_a+msg) \bmod q \\)
* Calculate: \\( s=(r+h*d_A) \bmod q \\)
* signature: \\((R,s)\\) ,  R is a compressed point R

## EdDSA verify signature

* Calculate: \\( h=hash(R+Q_a+msg) \bmod q \\)
* Calculate: \\( P_1=s*G \\)
* Calculate: \\( P_2=R+h*Q_a \\)
* Return \\( P_1==P_2 \\)

## Proof

\\( P_1=s\*G \\)  \
\\( =(r+h\*d_A) \*G \\)   \
\\( =r\*G + h\*d_A\*G\\)   \
\\( =R+h\*Q_a \\)      \
\\( = P_2 \\)

## ECDSA vs EdDSA

Both signature algorithms have similar security strength for curves with similar key length.For the most popular curves the EdDSA algorithm is slightly faster than ECDSA.But EdDSA do not provide a way to recover the singer's public key from the signature and message.

## The importance of random r

Assume you generate r with a random funtion instead of hash function, if you hava two signatures with the same r value, and it means you can calculate private key using signatures with msg hash.
\\( s_1=r+h_1\*d_A \\)    \
\\( s_2=r+h_2\*d_A \\)    \
\\( s_1-s_2=(h_1-h_2)d_A \\)  \
\\( d_A=\frac{s_1-s_2}{h_1-h_2} \\)
